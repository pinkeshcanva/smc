( PROJECT SMC ) Save My City 

Based on the success and initiatives of Project Surat, the idea for Project SMC (Save My City) is to create a digital solution platform to participate in the GDSC (Google Developer Student Club) Solution Challenge 2023. The goal of Project SMC is to promote sustainability, environmental conservation, and citizen engagement in various cities in India, taking inspiration from Project Surat.

The key features of Project SMC include:

Local and global Climate Action Plan: Similar to Project Surat, Project SMC aims to develop and implement climate action plans that address local and global environmental challenges, such as waste management, air pollution, water pollution, and biodiversity conservation.

Citizens well-being and happiness: Project SMC recognizes the importance of citizens' well-being and happiness in creating sustainable cities. Through various initiatives and campaigns, Project SMC aims to promote a sense of community, inclusivity, and well-being among citizens, regardless of their social background.

Sustainable development: Project SMC aims to promote sustainable development practices in cities by raising awareness about the importance of sustainability, advocating for sustainable policies and practices, and providing resources and support for sustainable initiatives.

Raising awareness: Similar to Project Surat, Project SMC aims to raise awareness among citizens about various environmental issues and sustainability practices through social media campaigns, workshops, consultations, and newspaper articles. Project SMC also aims to engage with a large number of residents directly and indirectly through social media and print media.

Initiatives: Project SMC plans to implement various initiatives, such as Safai Sunday (weekly cleaning at various locations), Aag Bhujao (campaign to stop waste burning), Tapi Shudhikaran (river pollution reduction initiative), Ley Dey Swap (barter event for exchanging preloved items), and Ecoktober Fest (month-long celebration promoting sustainable habits), among others, to engage citizens and promote sustainable practices in cities.

Collaboration: Project SMC aims to collaborate with various stakeholders, including government bodies, educational institutions, corporates, religious organizations, housing societies, and citizens, to promote sustainability and implement sustainable solutions.

Volunteering and zero-fund model: Similar to Project Surat, Project SMC will be based on volunteering work and a zero-fund model, relying on the efforts and contributions of volunteers to implement initiatives and campaigns.

The overall goal of Project SMC is to create a sustainable model city and inspire other cities in India and around the world to adopt sustainable practices for environmental conservation and citizen well-being. By participating in the GDSC Solution Challenge 2023, Project SMC aims to develop a digital solution that can further support its initiatives and promote sustainability in cities. Overall, Project SMC aims to make a positive impact on the environment, society, and citizen's well-being by creating a platform for sustainable development and citizen engagement. As an entry to the GDSC Solution Challenge 2023, Project SMC can showcase its digital solution and contribute to the global efforts towards sustainability and environmental conservation. With the inspiration and success of Project Surat, Project SMC aims to create a meaningful impact and become a leading environmental organization in India.
